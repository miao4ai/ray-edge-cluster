Ray Edge Cluster — Distributed Edge AI Framework for Raspberry Pi and Jetson

## 🌍 Overview
**Ray Edge Cluster** is a lightweight distributed computing framework designed for **Edge AI** scenarios — running across **Raspberry Pi clusters**, **Jetson Orin Nano**, or any other ARM-based devices.  
It leverages [Ray](https://www.ray.io) for unified task scheduling, actor management, and resource-aware distributed execution.

Typical use cases:
- Distributed image / sensor data preprocessing on Raspberry Pi nodes  
- GPU-accelerated inference on Jetson Orin Nano  
- Federated or collaborative model training at the edge  
- Edge → Cloud pipeline synchronization (via Ray Serve)
